## Some projects hosted here and others I've built or heavily contributed to:

[Remotion Emoji Library & Utilities](https://github.com/Remotionco/Emoji-Library-and-Utilities)
: At Remotion, we needed to present our own custom emoji picker. There wasn't (isn't) a decent API for accessing all emoji available on the system, so we created our own based on several canonical sources.

[iMedia Browser](https://github.com/karelia/iMedia)
: Apple didn't provide an API for third-party apps to browse local media, as Apple's own apps contained. This was an approximate re-creation of this UI, along with hooks for enhancement. Used by several dozen shipping apps!

[SwiftUICoreImage](https://github.com/danwood/SwiftUICoreImage)
: Hundreds of Core Image filters wrapped as CIImage modifiers for easy integration with SwiftUI
